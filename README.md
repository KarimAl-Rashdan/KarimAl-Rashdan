### Hi there, I'm Karim Al-Rashdan 👋🏽

## About Me

<p>I'm a Frontend Software Developer who is passionate about buidling exceptional user interfaces and experiences. With a strong background in UI/UX Design, I enjoy creating wireframes, interactive prototypes, and mockups to visualize and communicate design concepts utilizing Figma.</p>

## 🔭 What I'm Currently Working On

<p>I'm currently focusing on contributing my UI/UX Design expertise to Spoke, an open source text-distribution tool for organizations to mobilize supporters and members into action. I am also working on Job Hunt Tracker, a fullstack React app that allows Turing students to track job applications, and Turing administration to track student's job hunt progress.
